/*
  Traffic light state machine

  This state machine simulates a traffic light system with four states: stop, readyGo, go, and readyStop.
  Each state represents a different phase of the traffic light cycle, controlling both vehicle and pedestrian signals.

  - stop: 
    - Traffic lights are red, and pedestrian lights are green, allowing pedestrians to cross.
    - The system remains in this state for a specified stopPeriod before transitioning to readyGo.

  - beforeReadyGo:
    - Traffic lights are red, and pedestrian lights are red, stopping pedestrians from crossing.
    - The system remains in this state for a specified beforeReadyGoPeriod before transitioning to readyGo.

  - readyGo:
    - Traffic lights show red and amber, preparing vehicles to move.
    - Pedestrian lights remain green, but pedestrians should not start crossing.
    - After a readyGoPeriod, the system transitions to the go state.

  - go:
    - Traffic lights turn green, allowing vehicles to move.
    - Pedestrian lights are red, stopping pedestrian crossing.
    - The system can transition to the stop state upon receiving a 'stop' event, with pedestrians being warned to wait.

  - readyStop:
    - Traffic lights show amber, preparing vehicles to stop.
    - Pedestrian lights remain red.
    - After a readyStopPeriod, the system transitions back to the stop state.

  - afterReadyStop:
    - Traffic lights are red, and pedestrian lights are red, stopping pedestrians from crossing.
    - After a readyStopPeriod, the system transitions back to the stop state.
